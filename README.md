Just a quick note: Please remember to replace **"CSV FILE PATH"** with the path to your CSV file and **"OUTPUT file path(MUST be in .parquet format like hello.parquet)"** with the path where you want to save the Parquet file.

Also, donâ€™t forget to install the ChoETL.Parquet NuGet package before running the code. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal: **Install-Package ChoETL.Parquet**
(install ChoETL  using this console command in terminal:  install-package ChoETL.Parquet)
// **Note:** use this link to open Parquet File   https://www.parquet-viewer.com/#parquet-online
